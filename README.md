This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system that recommends music tracks based on the emotional state of the user. The system analyzes audio features of songs to categorize them into emotional categories such as "Happy," "Sad," "Devotional," "Party," and "Romantic."

It first gets the data of all the Indian Classical Music from Spotify it can find. Then the model is trained on the features using a pretrained music analysis model of Librosa. After it has extracted the features, it builds the neural network trained to categorize songs into different emotions given an emotional input. This can be scaled to be trained on more features with more data (since this was a sample project) and then it can be generalized for its own purpose. 

But my purpose was to show that technology can be used to spread Indian Classical Music.
